My final project for Tech Elevator coding boot camp.
This is the source code for an e-sports tournament hosting website that was created using Java, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Vue.js. The program implemented RESTful APIs, real-time match updates, and secure authentication. Users are able to create tournaments, observe live tournaments, create teams to join a tournament.
The site is live at https://nhatquang1306.github.io/match-found/
